Without practicing all the values of education in daily life, life of the students would be like plastic flowers, a fruits without taste! Bee hive without honey !

Education should help man to live a meaningful and purposeful life. Education should not focus all efforts to acquire just a livelihood alone.

Possession of these two aspects of education will bring not only respect in society, but also inner satisfaction and contentment. The head oriented worldly education has very little value and it is ephemeral. Spiritual education is for entire life, even after this life, whereas worldly education is for just a temporary living.

Synthesis of these two; Religion and Science will bring greatest blessings to the world.
