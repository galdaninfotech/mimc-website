He was brought up within a deeply religious family, amongst people who followed the ancient Buddhist traditions and believed in peacefulness, humility and innocence as the natural way of life. At the age of seventeen he joined the Indian Army, where he developed a strong sense of personal discipline and responsibility.

He left the mountains of Ladakh far behind and became a committed disciple of the renowned Buddhist scholar and celebrated monk, Venerable Acharya Buddharakkhita Mahathera, the abbot of the Mahabodhi Society Vihara, Bangalore, South India. Having received full ordination, Ven. Sanghasena undertook enthusiastic studies of the Dhamma and practiced various methods of Buddhist meditation.

In fact, the foundation stone for this historic park was laid by His Excellency, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, on 21 August 2017. The Buddha Park, envisioned as a symbol of world peace, holds immense significance in today's turbulent times. Spread across 10 acres within the MIMC campus, the park is thoughtfully designed to host a variety of spiritual and cultural programs, offering purpose-built facilities to cater to the unique needs of genuine seekers of truth and lovers of peace. At the very heart of the park stands a beautiful and serene statue of Lord Buddha, radiating an aura of peace and tranquility. One of the park's most awe-inspiring features is the magnificent “City of a Thousand Buddhas,” which comprises 1,000 life-sized statues of Lord Buddha, symbolizing unity and collective harmony. In addition to this centerpiece, the park is adorned with several other notable statues, including a 40-foot Sri Lankan Samadhi-style Buddha statue, a 15-foot sitting statue of Ven. Acharya Buddharakkhita— the revered teacher of Bhikkhu Sanghasena, a 20-foot standing statue of the Most Venerable Anagarika Dharmapala, and the reinstallation of a statue of Lord Buddha flanked by His two Chief Disciples, alongside Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Together, these sculptures create a profound space dedicated to promoting peace, wisdom, and spiritual awakening, making the park a beacon of hope and a sanctuary for all who visit.
